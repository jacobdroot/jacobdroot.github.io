I need to collect data on LEFT SIDE YIELD ON GREEN SIGNALS because it has been my life's work for the last two years.

The only data that needs to be collected is POINTS data

Non-spatial data: number of signal faces (3, 4 or 5); backplate status (YES, NO)


My data collection application will be designed to pinpoint traffic signals that are left-of-center of the intersection that include a circular green indication. These are rare signals in the state of Washington, and I have been trying to locate all of them for years. I only need to collect points data for this application. Non-spatial data would be how many signal faces are included (3, 4, or 5), whether there is a backplate (Yes, No), and how it is attached (Pole or Mast Arm).
